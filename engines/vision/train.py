"""EDITABLE training script for the image-classification engine (dependency-free STUB).

This is the single file the L1 agent may modify. It "trains" (the stub does nothing but pick
hyperparameters) and saves its config to $SCHOLARLOOP_ARTIFACT. It does NOT compute or report
the metric — the runner runs the frozen `prepare score` step on the artifact for the trusted
number, so an edited train.py cannot fabricate a result. The runner injects a hyperparameter
override via $SCHOLARLOOP_CONFIG.

Two edit channels (DESIGN §4.5): the runner sweeps the hparam space via the override
(parallel-safe, no source mutation); real architecture changes are made by editing this file.
