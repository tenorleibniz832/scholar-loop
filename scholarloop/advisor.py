"""The Advisor agent (DESIGN §3 step 7) — post-run loop control.

After an experiment, the Advisor reads the result against its parent and recent history and
decides the loop's next move:
  - PROCEED — the frontier advanced; keep iterating from here.
  - REFINE  — the direction is promising but this config missed; tweak and retry (bounded:
              the orchestrator forces a PIVOT after N consecutive refines).
  - PIVOT   — this direction is exhausted; change direction (orchestrator re-grounds via the
              Lit Scout / Director).

It only steers control flow; the metric still decides quality. Runs on the agent harness.
