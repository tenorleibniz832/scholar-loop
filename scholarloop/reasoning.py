"""Reasoning Layer (DESIGN §4.5), ReAct-light.

This module holds the *deterministic* substrate the LLM Reasoner stands on:

  - `analyze_search_space` — mine the ledger for which hyperparameter regions are
    exhausted (ruled out) and which knobs are high-leverage (worth focusing edits on).
    This is mechanism 2 ("Search-Space Reasoning"): it bounds the next experiment so the
    agent does not re-explore losing regions or fiddle low-impact knobs.
  - `calibration_error` / `score_prediction` — mechanism 1 ("Predict-then-Verify"): turn a
    predicted effect and the measured effect into a number, so reasoning that doesn't help
    is demoted by measurement rather than trusted on faith.
  - `is_duplicate_config` — config-level novelty so the same config isn't run twice.

The LLM Reasoner consumes a `SearchSpaceConstraints` (rendered via `to_prompt_block`) plus
literature/skills to write the trace + act; the Reflector calls `score_prediction` after.
Everything here is pure and testable with no LLM and no GPU.
