"""Agent harness — the scaffolding every LLM agent in ScholarLoop runs on.

Design principles (the "harnessing" that matters more than the agent count):
  1. Deterministic control flow lives in the orchestrator; an Agent is a stateless,
     pure function of its context — all durable state lives in the ledger, never in an agent.
  2. Every agent has a typed I/O contract (a JSON schema). The harness validates the
     output at the boundary and retries with feedback on a structural failure, so callers
     downstream always receive a well-formed object — never prose to parse.
  3. Checkable work (dedup, calibration, constraint enforcement) stays in code, not the
     agent. The agent only does the open-ended part; the harness keeps it honest.
  4. Every call is traced (agent name + attempts + output) for auditability. This is also
     where token/cost accounting plugs in once the LLMClient surfaces usage.

Concrete agents (Reasoner, LitScout, …) subclass `Agent`, declare `schema` + `system`,
and implement `build_prompt`; the harness owns validate → retry → trace.
