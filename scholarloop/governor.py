"""Loop governor (DESIGN §3 / §6) — the autonomous loop's stop conditions and budget control.

A long-running campaign should not run a fixed number of steps blindly: it should stop when it has
spent its money, exhausted its ideas, or run long enough. The `Governor` is a small, pure
state machine the Orchestrator consults once per round. It never calls an LLM, so it is fully
unit-testable on its own.

Three independent stop conditions (any one fires):
  - **budget** — a USD ceiling on cumulative LLM spend (with 50/80/100% alerts on the way up),
  - **rounds** — a hard cap on iterations,
  - **convergence** — `dry_patience` consecutive rounds with no frontier improvement ("loop-until-dry":
    keep going while ideas still help, stop once the search has clearly plateaued).
