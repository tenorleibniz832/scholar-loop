"""The Research Director (L4) — sets the campaign's direction and budget.

Given the ledger so far (what's been tried, the current frontier, recent verdicts) and any
literature hotspots, the Director picks the next research direction and a concrete `topic` for
the Lit Scout to search, plus a suggested step budget. It runs once at the start of a campaign
and again on a PIVOT, so the loop has a sense of *where to look*, not just *how to tweak*.

Higher-level than the Advisor (which only nudges the next config): the Director changes the
question being asked. Runs on the agent harness.
