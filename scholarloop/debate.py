"""Debate panel (DESIGN §4.6) — diverse/adversarial perspectives before spending a GPU.

Several persona critics (from `profile.debate_roles`, e.g. Innovator / Pragmatist /
Contrarian) each examine a proposal through a distinct lens and vote run / revise / reject.
The Contrarian specifically attacks the search-space reasoning.

IMPORTANT framing: the panel gates whether a proposal is *worth running* (saves budget on
low-value bets), NOT whether it is *good* — the ground-truth metric decides that after the
run. So the debate is never an LLM-judge used as an optimization target; it's a cheap filter
in front of the real evaluator. Each critic runs on the agent harness (schema-validated, traced).
