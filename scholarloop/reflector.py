"""The Reflector agent (DESIGN §4.5 mechanism 3) — compounds intuition after each run.

Given a completed experiment and its parent, the Reflector asks: what is the one transferable
lesson here? It weighs the prediction against the measurement (a large `calibration_error`
means the reasoning mispredicted — itself a strong signal), the verdict, and the config, then
emits a `{category, severity, mitigation}` lesson the Skill Library stores with time-decay.

Not every run yields a lesson — `worth_recording: false` skips it, so the library stays signal.
Runs on the agent harness (schema-validated, retried, traced). The lesson's timestamp is the
experiment's own `ts`, so decay is deterministic and tied to when the learning actually happened.
