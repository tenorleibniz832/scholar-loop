"""The minimal orchestration loop (DESIGN §3) — one ReAct-light iteration per step.

step():
  1. read the ledger,
  2. Reasoner proposes the next experiment (reason → act under search-space constraints),
  3. ENFORCE admissibility — a proposal in a ruled-out region or already tried is skipped,
     never run (this is the search-space limit binding),
  4. run it under the fidelity budget,
  5. the runner records the measured result + the prediction's calibration_error (Reflect).

This is the first point where the system actually researches by itself: it invents a
literature-grounded config, edits, validates, and remembers — with no human in the loop. It
runs end-to-end against MockLLM (no API, no GPU), so the whole cycle is unit-testable.

        Bounding the campaign (at least one is required, else it's a single round):
          - `n_steps` — a fixed round count (the classic mode), and/or
          - `governor` — a `Governor` that stops on a USD budget, a round cap, or convergence
            (`dry_patience` rounds with no frontier improvement). Checked at the top of each round.

        Each round is shaped by:
          - `population>1` — a parallel population funnel (propose N, smoke all, climb survivors),
          - else `funnel=True` — one idea through smoke→verify→full,
          - else a single flat run at `fidelity`.
