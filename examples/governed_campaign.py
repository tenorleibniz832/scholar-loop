"""Loop engineering demo: a PARALLEL POPULATION FUNNEL under a self-stopping GOVERNOR.

Deterministic and free — scripted by `MockLLM` on the dependency-free stub engine, so it runs in
well under a second with no API key and no GPU. It shows the two loop-engineering pieces:

  - `population_step(k, max_workers=...)` — propose k ideas, smoke-screen them ALL in parallel,
    then climb only the survivors up verify -> full (expensive tiers spent on a pre-screened few).
  - `Governor(...)` — the campaign loop stops itself on a budget / round cap / convergence
    (`dry_patience` rounds with no frontier improvement), instead of running a fixed length.
